# trytodecrypt-Scripts
A place where I store the python scripts I made to solve the puzzles on www.trytodecrypt.com.
Files starting *sorting out stuff* refer to questions where each char has the length of the number following *sorting out stuff*.
For example, *sorting out stuff for 3* refers to the question where one char encrypted could look like *H2O*.
